"""Tool definitions for the skills system.

This module creates the two LangChain tools that let the LLM interact with
the local skill store:

- ``load_skill(skill_name)`` — returns the full SKILL.md content plus a list
  of available supporting files.
- ``read_skill_file(skill_name, filename)`` — returns the content of a
  specific supporting file from a skill's directory.

**Why are these tools and not just system-prompt context?** Loading all skills
into the system prompt would consume too many tokens and dilute the LLM's
attention. By exposing skills as tools, the LLM can selectively load only the
knowledge it needs for the current task (progressive disclosure).

**Why a factory function?** The tools need a reference to the ``SkillStore``
instance, which is created at runtime. The ``create_skill_tools()`` factory
captures the store via closure, so each tool invocation reads from the same
cached store.

**Dynamic docstrings**: After creation, each tool's docstring is overwritten
to include the list of available skill names. This is critical because the
LLM sees tool docstrings as part of the tool schema — without the skill list,
the LLM wouldn't know which skill names are valid arguments.
